### 01/01 Terminologies

# Engineering
According to WikiPedia:
Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering 
design process to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and 
improve systems.

## Agile

# What is part of Computer Science that is not Software Engineering?

One is that computer science deals with the science behind the interaction between hardware and software systems and
computational applications, whereas software engineering typically deals with the engineering principles of building,
designing and testing software products.

Computer Science includes areas such as theoretical computation, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computer 
hardware design, which focus on the underlying principles and mechanisms of computing. These fields are more about
understanding how computers work rather than building complete software systems.

# How is Software Engineering different from Programming?

Programming involves writing code to create software, focusing mainly on the act of coding and problem-solving in a 
specific language. Software Engineering, on the other hand, is a broader discipline that encompasses planning, designing,
testing, and maintaining software systems, applying systematic methodologies to ensure reliability and scalability.

#  Where did Software Engineering come from?

The concept of software engineering emerged in the late 1960s, with the recognition that computer programming required a
disciplined approach similar to that of traditional engineering. Software Engineering emerged in the 1960s in response to 
the "software crisis," when many large-scale projects were failing 
or over budget due to inadequate development practices. It was driven by the need to apply engineering principles to 
software development to improve quality, reliability, and manageability. During this period, key figures such as Dijkstra,
Brooks and Knuth played a crucial role in shaping the field.


#  How has Software Engineering changed over the years?

Over time, Software Engineering has shifted from rigid, plan-driven models like the waterfall approach to more adaptive,
iterative methods such as Agile and Scrum, which emphasize flexibility and continuous feedback. Advances in tools, 
automation, and collaborative practices have also enhanced how teams design, build, and maintain complex software systems.

# Basic programming to a sophisticated, evolving discipline that underpins the complex systems we rely on today

Early Days:
In the beginning, programming was a simple yet error-prone process, involving writing instructions in machine code. As
computers evolved, so did the need for more structured methods to build reliable software.

Birth of Software Engineering:
The term "software engineering" was coined at a NATO conference in 1968 to promote a disciplined, engineering-like 
approach to software development, addressing the growing complexity and challenges of programming.

Development Methodologies:
The 1970s saw the introduction of models like the Waterfall method, which followed a linear, step-by-step process.
Later, more flexible approaches such as iterative development and Agile emerged to better handle changes and adapt to 
evolving requirements.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
In the 1980s and 1990s, OOP revolutionized software design by promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code. 
This shift led to widespread adoption of design patterns and principles that supported building large-scale systems.

Modern Trends:
Recently, there's been a move from monolithic applications to microservices, which break systems into small, independent
services for greater scalability and resilience. Emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and DevOps practices
continue to shape the future of software engineering.
