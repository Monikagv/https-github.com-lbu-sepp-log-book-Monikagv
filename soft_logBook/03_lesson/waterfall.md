## Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential project management and software development methodology. It follows a 
structured approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. It is often used in projects with 
well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.

## Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. Requirements Gathering

        1, All project requirements are collected and documented in detail.
        2, The final product's functionality is fully defined before development begins.

2. System Design
   
        1, The system architecture and software design are created based on the requirements.
        2, This includes defining data structures, system interfaces, and user interfaces.

3. Implementation (Coding & Development)

        1, Developers write the code based on the design specifications.
        2, Each module or component is developed separately.

4. Testing (Verification & Validation)The developed system undergoes rigorous testing to find and fix defects.

         1, The developed system undergoes rigorous testing to find and fix defects.
         2, Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

5. Deployment
   
         1, The software is deployed to the production environment. It becomes available for users.
         2, It becomes available for users. 

6. Maintenance

         1, Fixing bugs and making minor improvements as needed.
         2, Includes software updates and enhancements.

8. Key Characteristics

* Rigid & Structured: Follows a strict sequence; no phase starts until the previous one is complete.
* Documentation-Heavy: Requires extensive documentation at every stage.
* Less Flexibility: Changes are difficult to accommodate once the project progresses.
* Best for Well-Defined Projects: Suitable when requirements are clear and unlikely to change.

9. Advantages
* Simple and easy to understand.
* Works well for small, well-defined projects.
* Clear documentation and well-structured phases.
* Early detection of potential issues in planning.

10. Disadvantages
* Not suitable for projects with evolving requirements.
* High risk if requirements are misunderstood.
* Late testing phase may lead to costly fixes.
* No working software is available until late in the process.

11. When to Use the Waterfall Model
* Projects with clear, fixed requirements.
* When documentation and regulatory compliance are essential.
* In industries like construction, manufacturing, and traditional software development.
