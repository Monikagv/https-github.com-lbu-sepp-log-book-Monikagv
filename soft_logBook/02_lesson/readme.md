### A programming language, Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have a few implementation 
dependencies as possible. Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core
component of Sun's Java platform. It is a general-purpose programing language intended to let programmers write once,
run anywhere (WORA-write once, run anywhere, was a slogan to illustrate the cross-platform benefits in 1995), making 
that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are 
typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of teh underlying computer architecture.
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime 
provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in 
traditional compiled languages.

Java is:
 -High-level: Java abstracts many low-level tasks (e.g., memory management) so you can focus on the application logic rather than system details
 -Object-Oriented: Encourages modular design and code reuse via classes, objects, and interfaces
 -Platform-Independent: Java code si compiled into bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it "write
once, run anywhere"
 -Robust and Secure: Automatic memory management (garbage collection) and a strict typed system help prevent common 
programming errors.

Key Features and Concepts:
 - JVM(Java Virtual Machine) executes Java bytecode, allowing Java programs to run on any machine with a compatible 
   JVM implementation.
 - Java Development Kit(JDK). A software development kit that includes teh Java compiler (javac) and essential tools 
   to create, compile, and run Java programs.
 - Garbage Collection, Java automatically manages memory, freeing up objects that are no longer in use, reducing the 
   risk of memory leaks.
 - Rich Standard Library, Java offers a vast collection of libraries (collectively known as the Java Standard Library)
   for tasks like data structures, networking, I\O, GUI development, and more.
 - Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
   -Classes and objects: Basic building blocks for creating and organising code.
   - Inheritance: Allows you to create specialised classes by extending functionality of existing classes.
   - Polymorphism: Lets you work with objects in different classes in a unified way.
   - Encapsulation: Protects data by restricting direct access to the internals of a class.
 
Java is one of the most popular programming languages. Java programs can run on different platforms, including mobile, 
desktop, and other portable systems. You can use Java to build apps, games, banking applications, web app, and much more.



### C++

* Introduction:

C++ is a very popular, high-level, object-oriented, general-purpose programming languages that is made to create applications
and system programming. It was made by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as a continuation of C programming language.
It focuses on procedural, functional, and generic programming styles, which help develop operating systems, or creating 
applications but nowadays mainly used in game development. It is used to write efficient codes for larger applications,e.g.:
games, software, and graphical user interfaces.

* Key features of C++ programming languages
Writing a program should follow a program structure, which starts with the #include statement that should be added to the
headerd
