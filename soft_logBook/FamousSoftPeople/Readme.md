# Margaret Hamilton
Margaret Elaine Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist.
She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory,
which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo program. She later founded two 
software companies, Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Half a century ago, MIT played a critical role in the development of the flight software for NASA’s Apollo program, 
which landed humans on the Moon for the first time in 1969. One of the many contributors to this effort was Margaret 
Hamilton, a computer scientist who led the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory,
which in 1961 contracted with NASA to develop the Apollo program’s guidance system.
For her work during this period, Hamilton has been credited with popularizing the concept of software engineering.

# Donald Knuth
Donald Ervin Knuth (born January 10, 1938) is an American 
computer scientist and mathematician. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University.
He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize 
of computer science. Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".

# David Parnas

David Lorge Parnas (born February 10, 1941) is a Canadian early pioneer of software engineering, 
who developed the concept of information hiding in modular programming, which is an important element of 
object-oriented programming today. He is also noted for his advocacy of precise documentation.

# Robert C. Martin

Robert Cecil Martin (born 5 December 1952), colloquially called "Uncle Bob", is an American software engineer,
instructor, and author. He is most recognized for promoting many software design principles and for being an author 
and signatory of the influential Agile Manifesto.

## FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE LEADERS

# Richard Stallman
Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), also known by his initials, rms,
is an American free software movement activist and programmer.He started the GNU Project to create a completely free 
(as in freedom) operating system. He believes that people should be able to use, study, and change their software
without restrictions. He campaigns for software to be distributed in such a manner that its users have the freedom to 
use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software which ensures these freedoms is termed free software. 
Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in October 1985, developed the GNU
Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote all versions of the GNU General 
Public License

# Eric S. Raymond
He wrote influential essays about how open, community-driven software development (where anyone can contribute) can 
be better than closed, secretive methods. His ideas helped promote the open source movement.

# Linus Torvalds
Linus Benedict Torvalds born 28 December 1969 is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and lead developer
of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed version control system Git.

# PIONEERS IN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

# Kernighan and Ritchie:
They helped create the C programming language and co-wrote a famous book about it. C is a foundational language that
influenced many others and is widely used for system programming.

# Bjarne Stroustrup
He developed C++, which is an enhanced version of C that adds features for object-oriented programming, making it easier
to build complex software like games and applications.

# Larry Wall:
He created Perl, a programming language known for its ability to process text. Perl became popular for tasks like 
system administration and web development.

# EXPERTS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES

# Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt:
They wrote "The Pragmatic Programmer," a book that gives practical advice for writing good code and being a flexible, 
resourceful programmer.

# "Uncle" Bob Martin (Robert C. Martin):
He advocates for writing “clean code” that is easy to understand and maintain. He also supports Agile methods, 
which help teams work in short, efficient cycles to improve software continuously.

# Kent Beck:
He was a key figure in developing Extreme Programming (XP) and test-driven development (TDD). His work focuses on 
writing code that is constantly checked for errors and quickly adapted to changes.

# Jeff Sutherland:
He co-created Scrum, an Agile framework that organizes work into short periods (sprints) to make managing software
projects easier and more flexible.

 # Guido van Rossum

 # Bjarne Stroustrup

 # Kernighan and Ritchie

 # James Gosling
