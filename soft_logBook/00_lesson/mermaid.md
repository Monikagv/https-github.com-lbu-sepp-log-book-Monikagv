# Mermaid

* Mermaid is a JavaScript-based tool that allows you to create diagrams and visual representations using a text-based 
syntax. Instead of drawing diagrams manually, you can write simple text instructions, and Mermaid will automatically 
generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more.
