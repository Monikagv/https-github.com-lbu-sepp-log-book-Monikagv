# Agile

Agile is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer
satisfaction. It focuses on delivering smaller pieces of work regularly instead of one large launch, allowing teams to 
adapt to changes quickly and provide customer value faster. The Agile Manifesto outlines its core values, prioritizing 
individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodologies 
include various frameworks, such as Scrum and Kanban, which help teams implement Agile principles effectively.
