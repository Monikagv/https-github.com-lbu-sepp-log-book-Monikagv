# GIT

## What Is Git?

* Git is a technology that can be used to track changes to a project and to help multiple people to collaborate on a
* project. At a basic level, a project version controlled by Git consists of a folder with files in it, and Git tracks 
* the changes that are made to the files in the project. This allows you to save different versions of the work you’re 
* doing, which is why we call Git a version control system.


* The Graphical User Interface and the Command Line The two main ways to interact with a computer are by using the 
graphical user interface or the command line. The command line— also known as the command line interface (CLI), terminal,
* or shell— is a place where you can type text-based commands to interact with your computer.

## Command options and arguments

* Options are settings that changed the behavior of a command. An option follows a single dash (-) or a double dash (--)
* Arguments are values that provide information to the command. They will be denoted by angle brackets (<>), indicating 
* that these items should be replaced with user-supplied values. in
