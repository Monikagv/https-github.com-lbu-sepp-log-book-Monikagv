### 01/01 Terminologies

# Engineering
According to WikiPedia:
Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering 
design process to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and 
improve systems.

well engineered
 ➢ Is durable.
 ➢ Is designed so as to be straightforward to maintain.
 ➢ Was produced and delivered within certain constraints (time, cost, etc).
 ➢ "Looks good"

# Programming
 (And Engineering)
 Programming is the process of turning a specification into working computer code. 
 It is basically a mechanical, simple process (as we can see from the application of AI).
 You might be asked to program some sorting algorithm, which could be an interesting 
intellectual exercise, if nothing else. 
 Programming involves little, if any, creativity.
 Software Engineering  is much more than this.

## Agile

# What is part of Computer Science that is not Software Engineering?

One is that computer science deals with the science behind the interaction between hardware and software systems and
computational applications, whereas software engineering typically deals with the engineering principles of building,
designing and testing software products.

Computer Science includes areas such as theoretical computation, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computer 
hardware design, which focus on the underlying principles and mechanisms of computing. These fields are more about
understanding how computers work rather than building complete software systems.

# How is Software Engineering different from Programming?

Programming involves writing code to create software, focusing mainly on the act of coding and problem-solving in a 
specific language. Software Engineering, on the other hand, is a broader discipline that encompasses planning, designing,
testing, and maintaining software systems, applying systematic methodologies to ensure reliability and scalability.

#  Where did Software Engineering come from?

The concept of software engineering emerged in the late 1960s, with the recognition that computer programming required a
disciplined approach similar to that of traditional engineering. Software Engineering emerged response to 
the "software crisis," when many large-scale projects were failing or over budget due to inadequate development practices.
It was driven by the need to apply engineering principles to software development to improve quality, reliability, and
manageability. During this period, key figures such as Dijkstra, Brooks and Knuth played a crucial role in shaping the field.


#  How has Software Engineering changed over the years?

Over time, Software Engineering has shifted from rigid, plan-driven models like the waterfall approach to more adaptive,
iterative methods such as Agile and Scrum, which emphasize flexibility and continuous feedback. Advances in tools, 
automation, and collaborative practices have also enhanced how teams design, build, and maintain complex software systems.

# Basic programming to a sophisticated, evolving discipline that underpins the complex systems we rely on today

Early Days:
In the beginning, programming was a simple yet error-prone process, involving writing instructions in machine code. As
computers evolved, so did the need for more structured methods to build reliable software.

Birth of Software Engineering:
The term "software engineering" was coined at a NATO conference in 1968 to promote a disciplined, engineering-like 
approach to software development, addressing the growing complexity and challenges of programming.

Development Methodologies:
The 1970s saw the introduction of models like the Waterfall method, which followed a linear, step-by-step process.
Later, more flexible approaches such as iterative development and Agile emerged to better handle changes and adapt to 
evolving requirements.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
In the 1980s and 1990s, OOP revolutionized software design by promoting modular, reusable, and maintainable code. 
This shift led to widespread adoption of design patterns and principles that supported building large-scale systems.

Modern Trends:
Recently, there's been a move from monolithic applications to microservices, which break systems into small, independent
services for greater scalability and resilience. Emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and DevOps practices
continue to shape the future of software engineering.

# The Evolution of Software Engineering: From Principles to Practice
Software engineering is a rapidly evolving field that has come a long way since its inception. It has transformed the 
world in countless ways, making it possible to develop complex systems and applications that power our daily lives. 
In this article, we will explore the history and progression of software engineering, from its early days of simple
programming to the sophisticated principles and practices that shape the industry today.

The Birth of Software Engineering
In the early days of computing, programming was a relatively straightforward process that involved writing instructions 
in machine code, which was tedious and error-prone. As computers became more powerful and programming languages were 
developed, the need for structured software development methodologies arose.

In 1968, the term ‘software engineering’ was coined in a conference held at NATO. It aimed to establish software 
development as a disciplined engineering practice, similar to other engineering disciplines like civil or mechanical 
engineering. This marked the birth of software engineering as a distinct field.

Early Development Methodologies
During the 1970s, various software development methodologies emerged to improve the efficiency and reliability of 
software engineering processes. One of the earliest approaches was the Waterfall model, which followed a sequential, 
linear process with distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Although the Waterfall model provided a clear structure, it had limitations in handling changes and adaptability. 
This led to the emergence of iterative and incremental development methodologies like the Spiral model and Agile methodology.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming
In the 1980s and 1990s, object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software development. OOP offered a modular and
reusable approach, allowing developers to create flexible and maintainable code. The introduction of object-oriented 
design principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism paved the way for building large-scale systems.

With the rise of OOP, software engineering started to emphasize reusability, modularity, and scalability. Design patterns
became a crucial aspect of software architecture, enabling developers to address common design problems and promote 
code reuse.

The Paradigm Shift: From Monolithic to Microservices
In recent years, the software engineering landscape has seen a shift towards microservices architecture. Traditionally,
software systems were built as monolithic applications, where all components were tightly coupled. This made it challenging 
to scale and maintain these systems.

Microservices architecture, on the other hand, promotes the development of small, loosely coupled services that can be
independently deployed, scaled, and maintained. This modular approach allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and 
fault tolerance, making it easier to build and evolve complex systems.

The Future of Software Engineering
As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, the future of software engineering remains bright. Emerging
trends like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain are transforming the industry, opening up new 
possibilities and challenges for software engineers.

Additionally, software engineering is evolving beyond traditional development practices. DevOps, for example, focuses on
streamlining the collaboration between developers and operations teams to accelerate software delivery and improve 
overall product quality.

With the increasing importance of cybersecurity, software engineers are also playing a vital role in developing secure 
and resilient software systems. The integration of security practices into the software development lifecycle is crucial 
to protect against ever-growing threats.

Conclusion
From its humble beginnings to its current state, software engineering has come a long way. It has evolved from simple 
programming to a discipline that encompasses principles, methodologies, and architectural patterns. As technology 
continues to progress, software engineering will continue to evolve to meet the demands of an ever-changing world.
